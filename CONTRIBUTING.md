Thank you for your interest in contributing to **KeyShell**, an open-source Linux shell built for learning and practical use! This project focuses on implementing fundamental shell features using `fork()` and `exec()`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before contributing, ensure you have:
* A Linux-based operating system (or WSL on Windows)
* GCC or Clang installed
* Git installed

### Setting Up the Project
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/KeyShell.git
   cd KeyShell
   ```
3. Compile the shell:
   ```sh
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make 
   make run
   ```
4. Run the shell:
   ```sh
   ./shell
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue with:
* A clear description of the problem
* Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
* Expected behavior vs. actual behavior

### Submitting Code
1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
2. Make your modifications.
3. Run tests and ensure the shell functions correctly.
4. Commit your changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add feature: description"
   ```
5. Push your branch and create a pull request.

### Code Style
* Follow standard C coding conventions.
* Use meaningful variable names and comments.
* Keep functions small and modular.

## Features to Work On
New contributors can help with:
* Implementing built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`, `pwd`, etc.)
* Adding input/output redirection
* Supporting background processes (`&` operator)
* Enhancing error handling and debugging
* Improving the command history feature
